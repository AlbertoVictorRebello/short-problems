# Problem proposed:
Write a function that takes two arrays (a and b) as arguments
Create an object that has properties with keys 'a' and corresponding values 'b'
Return the object
function myFunction(a, b){
  return 
}

myFunction(['a','b','c'],[1,2,3]
The console output shall be {a:1,b:2,c:3}â€Š

My final code has three proposed solutions. To be able to develop them it is necessary that one is able to put in practice the following concepts:

1) Arrays: know what is an array and how to access the elements of an array.
    Verification: create an array  and print one of its elements using console.log().

2) Functions: know what is a function and how to create a function that recives 2 arguments.
     Verification: creat a function that receives 2 arguments and  print both using console.log().

3) Objetcts: know what is an object, their properties and how to create an object with properties.
     Verification: create an object with properties and e print the object using console.log().

3) Objetcts: know how to create an empty object and add properties to it.
     Verification: create an empty object, add some properties and e print the object using console.log().
